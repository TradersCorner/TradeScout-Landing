          <article id="contractor-selection-guide">
            <h4>How to Select the Right Contractor for Your Project</h4>
            <p>Research contractors thoroughly: verify license through state board, confirm insurance coverage, check Better Business Bureau rating, read online reviews, ask for recent references, visit recent job sites if possible. Get 3-5 written estimates comparing scope, materials, timeline, warranty terms.</p>
            <p>Red flags to avoid: door-to-door solicitation, cash-only payment, large upfront payments, no written contract, no license/insurance, significantly low bids, high-pressure tactics, no local references, no physical business address.</p>
            <p>Contract essentials: detailed scope of work, specific materials/brands, start and completion dates, payment schedule tied to milestones, change order procedures, cleanup responsibilities, warranty terms, lien waiver provisions.</p>
          </article>
          
          <article id="permit-requirements">
            <h4>When Do You Need Permits for Contractor Work?</h4>
            <p>Most electrical, plumbing, structural, HVAC, and roofing work requires permits. Kitchen and bathroom remodels typically need permits. Cosmetic work like painting usually doesn't. Requirements vary by location - check with local building department.</p>
            <p>Contractors should handle permit applications and fees. Permits protect homeowners by ensuring code compliance and proper inspections. Work without required permits can cause insurance and resale issues.</p>

          <article id="seasonal-contractor-tips">
            <h4>Best Times to Hire Contractors by Season</h4>
            <p>Spring: Ideal for exterior work starting - painting, roofing, landscaping. Book early as contractors fill up quickly. Good weather allows projects to stay on schedule.</p>
            <p>Summer: Peak season for exterior work. Higher demand may increase prices. Plan well in advance. Good for major projects with predictable weather.</p>
            <p>Fall: Great time for interior projects. Contractors may offer discounts as exterior season ends. Perfect for planning winter projects.</p>
            <p>Winter: Best prices for interior work. Limited exterior work availability. Storm damage repairs may take longer due to weather.</p>

          <article id="contractor-payment-guide">
            <h4>Safe Payment Practices When Hiring Contractors</h4>
            <p>Never pay large amounts upfront. Typical payment schedule: 10% down, progress payments tied to completion milestones, final payment after completion and satisfaction. Pay by check or credit card for protection.</p>
            <p>For materials: pay suppliers directly or get lien waivers. Large projects may require materials deposit, but verify delivery before payment. Get receipts for all payments and maintain detailed records.</p>
